## Singleton

#### What is the Singleton Design Pattern in JavaScript?
The Singleton Design Pattern in JavaScript is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This means that no matter how many times you try to create a new instance of the class, you will always get the same instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. For example, if you have a logging system in your application, you might want to have only one instance of the logger to avoid inconsistencies in the log.

#### Cons

* Harder to test as we can't instantiate it inside a test multiple times
* Having a global state might lead to tight coupling between classes, less flexible code

#### Use cases

* Logging service
* Configuration manager
* Cache manager
* Database connection

## Factory

A "factory" can be a simple function that allows us to create new objects without using the `new` keyword.
it can also refer to:
* a function or method that creates a programâ€™s GUI;
* a class that creates users;
* static method that calls a class constructor in a certain way;
* one of the creational design patterns.

##### Terms
- factory = simple function that returns new objects
- creation method = a method that creates objects
- static creation method = a static method that creates objects
- **simple factory pattern** = a function that creates different objects based on conditions





#### Pros
* Useful when you want to create multiple smaller objects
#### Cons
* ?
#### Use cases



## Builder

Useful when you want to create different representations of some product or when building complex objects and you want to separate the implementation from the client.

It's composed of
* Entity interface + concrete class
* Builder interface + builder concrete class
* Director - optional

The director can further hide the implementation by exposing fewer simpler methods within which the build process steps are called.
exp. `makeSportCar()` can be a method that inside calls multiple methods from the builder.
